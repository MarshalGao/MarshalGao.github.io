<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>introduction

<ul>
<li>the value of using any type of IT</li>
<li>potential availability of more and more information throughout the SC</li>
<li>its implications on effective design and management of the integrated SC</li>
<li>information changes the way supply chains can and should be effectively managed, and these changes may lead to lower inventories</li>
<li>using accurate information effectively does make the design and management of the SC more complex</li>
</ul></li>
<li>benefits

<ul>
<li>helps the coordination of manufacturing and distribution systems and strategies</li>
<li>helps suppliers make better forecasts accounting for promotions/market changes</li>
<li>helps reduce variability in supply chain</li>
<li>enables lead time reductions</li>
<li>enables retailers to react and adapt to supply problems more rapidly</li>
<li>enables retailers to better serve their customers by offering tools for locating desired items</li>

<li>features

<ul>
<li>the increase in variability going upstream in the supply chain</li>
<li>distributors’ orders placed to the factory fluctuated much more than retail sales</li>
<li>increase in variability as traveling up in the SC is referred to as the bullwhip effect – upstream echelons face higher variability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>objectives

<ul>
<li>control the increase in variability in SC</li>
<li>identify techniques and tools that will control the bullwhip effect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>factors of increased variability

<ul>
<li>demand forecasting

<ul>
<li>order-up-to points are modified as forecasts change – orders increase more than forecasts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>inflated orders

<ul>
<li>in case out of stock (e.g. over Christmas)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lead time

<ul>
<li>long lead times magnify long cycle time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>batch ordering

<ul>
<li>volume and transportation discounts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>price fluctuation

<ul>
<li>promotional sales</li>
<li>forward buying</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>quantify the bullwhip effect</p>

<ul>
<li><p>single retailer, single manufacturer</p>

<ul>
<li>retailer observes customer demand, <span  class="math">\(D_t\)</span></li>
<li>retailer orders <span  class="math">\(q_t\)</span> from manufacturer</li>
<li>L is the lead time
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarshalGao/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2021-06-15%2016.10.43.png" alt=""></figure></li>
<li>Var(Q), the variance of the orders placed by that retailer to the distributor</li>
<li>Var(D), the variance of the customer demand seen by the retailer</li>
<li>ratio of variability (ratio of safety stock)
<br></li>
</ul>

<p><span  class="math">\[\frac{Var(Q)}{Var(D)} \geq 1 + \frac{2L}{p} + \frac{2L^2}{p^2}\]</span></p>

<ul>
<li>when p is large, and L is small, the bullwhip effect due to forecasting errors negligible
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarshalGao/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2021-06-15%2016.16.04.png" alt=""></figure></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>multi-stage supply chains</p>

<ul>
<li>stage i places order <span  class="math">\(q_i\)</span> to stage i+1</li>
<li><span  class="math">\(L_i\)</span> is lead time between stage i and i+1
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarshalGao/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2021-06-15%2016.18.17.png" alt=""></figure></li>
<li>Var(<span  class="math">\(Q^k\)</span>) the variance of the orders placed by the k-th stage of the supply chain</li>
<li>Var(D) the variance of the customer demand seen by the retailer</li>
<li><span  class="math">\(L_i\)</span> is the lead time between stage i and stage i + 1</li>

<li><p>decentralized</p>

<ul>
<li>the variance increases multiplicatively at each stage of the supply chain
<br></li>
</ul>

<p><span  class="math">\[\frac{Var(Q^k)}{Var(D)} \geq \prod^{k-1}_{i=1} (1 + \frac{2L_i}{p} + \frac{2L_i^2}{p^2})\]</span></p>

<ul>
<li>each stage bases orders on previous stage’s demand</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>centralized</p>

<ul>
<li>increasing function of the total lead time between that stage and the retailer</li>
</ul>

<p><span  class="math">\[\frac{Var(Q^k)}{Var(D)} \geq 1 + \frac{2 \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} L_i}{p} + \frac{2 \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} L_i^2}{p^2}\]</span></p>

<ul>
<li>the variance of the orders placed by a given stage of a supply chain is an increasing function of the total lead time between that stage and the retailer</li>
<li>centralizing demand information can significantly reduce, but will not eliminate, the bull-whip effect</li>
<li>each stage bases orders on retailer’s forecast demand
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarshalGao/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2021-06-15%2016.29.03.png" alt=""></figure></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>managerial insights</p>

<ul>
<li>exists, in part, due to the retailer’s need to estimate the mean and variance of demand</li>
<li>the increase in variability is an increasing function of the lead time</li>
<li>the more complicated the demand models, the greater the increase</li>
<li>centralized demand information can significantly reduce the bullwhip effect, but will not eliminate it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Methods to cope with bullwhip effect</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>reducing uncertainty

<ul>
<li>centralizing demand information</li>
<li>different forecasting methods and different buying practices may contribute to the bullwhip effect</li>
<li>even same forecasting method and same ordering policy, the bullwhip effect will continue to exist

<ul>
<li>point-of-sale (POS)</li>
<li>sharing information</li>
<li>sharing forecasts and policies</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>reducing variability

<ul>
<li>eliminate promotions</li>
<li>“everyday low pricing” (EDLP) strategy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lead time reduction

<ul>
<li>order lead times vs. delivery lead times</li>
<li>EDI</li>
<li>cross docking</li>
</ul></li>
<li>strategic partnerships

<ul>
<li>vendor managed inventory (VMI)</li>
<li>data sharing</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distribution-strategies">Distribution Strategies</h2>

<p><strong>3 fundamental distribution strategies</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>directly shipped

<ul>
<li>from the supplier or manufacturer to the retail stores or end customer</li>
<li>the manufacturer or supplier delivers goods directly to retail stores

<ul>
<li>the retailer avoids the expenses of operating a distribution center <span  class="math">\(\uparrow\)</span></li>
<li>lead times are reduced <span  class="math">\(\uparrow\)</span></li>
<li>risk-pooling effects are negated because there is no central warehouse <span  class="math">\(\downarrow\)</span></li>
<li>the manufacturer and distributor transportation costs increase for sending smaller trucks to more locations <span  class="math">\(\downarrow\)</span></li>
<li>retail store requires fully loaded trucks; often mandated by powerful retailers; lead time is critical; manufacturer may be reluctant but may have no choice; prevalent in the grocery industry-lead times are critical because of perishable goods</li>
</ul></li>
<li>powerful retailers or lead time is critical</li>
</ul></li>
<li>intermediate inventory storage points

<ul>
<li>typically warehouses and/or distribution centers</li>
<li>issues with warehouses

<ul>
<li>manufacturing strategy (make-to-stock vs. make-to-order)</li>
<li>number of warehouses</li>
<li>inventory policy</li>
<li>inventory turn over ratio</li>
<li>internal warehouses vs. outside distributor</li>
<li>owned by a single firm or by a variety of firms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>details

<ul>
<li>variety of characteristics distinguish different strategies - length of time inventory is stored at warehouses and distribution centers</li>
<li>traditional warehousing strategy

<ul>
<li>distribution centers and warehouses hold stock inventory</li>
<li>provide their downstream customers with inventory as needed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>cross-docking strategy

<ul>
<li>warehouses and distribution centers serve as transfer points for inventory</li>
<li>no inventory is held at these transfer points</li>
</ul></li>
<li>centralized pooling and transshipment strategies

<ul>
<li>may be useful when there is a large variety of different products</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>cross docking

<ul>
<li>warehouses function as inventory coordination points rather than as inventory storage points</li>
<li>goods arrive at warehouses from the manufacturer, are transferred to vehicles serving the retailers, and are delivered to the retailers as rapidly as possible</li>
<li>goods spend very little time in storage at the warehouse—often less than 12 hours</li>
<li>difficulties

<ul>
<li>distribution centers, retailers, and suppliers must be linked with advanced information systems to ensure that all pickups and deliveries are made within the required time windows</li>
<li>effective only for large distribution systems that a large number of vehicles are delivering and picking up goods</li>
<li>require a significant start-up investment and are very difficult to manager</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Selection of distribution strategy</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>factors

<ul>
<li>customer demand and location</li>
<li>service level</li>
<li>product type</li>
<li>osts (including transportation and inventory)</li>
<li>demand variability</li>
<li>lead time</li>
<li>volume requirements</li>
<li>capital investment, etc</li>

<p><strong>Centralized vs. decentralized management</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>decentralized system

<ul>
<li>each facility identifies its most effective strategy without considering the impact on the other facilities in the supply chain</li>
<li>leads to local optimization</li>
</ul></li>
<li>centralized system

<ul>
<li>ecisions are made at a central location for the entire supply network</li>
<li>centralized control leads to global optimization</li>
<li>at least as effective as the decentralized system</li>
<li>allow use of coordinated strategies</li>
<li>if system cannot be centralized - often helpful to form partnerships to approach the a centralized system</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transshipment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>content

<ul>
<li>the shipment of items between different facilities at the same level in the SC to meet some immediate need

<ul>
<li>rapid transportation options</li>
<li>advanced information systems</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>risk pooling

<ul>
<li>view inventory in different retail outlets as part of a large, single pool</li>
</ul></li>
<li>homogeneous vs. heterogeneous

<ul>
<li>distributor integration</li>
<li>e.g., car dealer, traveling agent</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Central vs. local facilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>safety stock

<ul>
<li>consolidating warehouses: risk pooling</li>
<li>the more centralized an operation is, the lower safety stock levels will be</li>
</ul></li>
<li>overhead

<ul>
<li>operating a few large central warehouses leads to lower total overhead cost relative to operating many smaller ones</li>
</ul></li>
<li>economies of scale

<ul>
<li>more expensive to operate many small facilities than to operate a few large facilities (same total capacity)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lead time

<ul>
<li>can be reduced if a large number of warehouses are located closer to the market</li>
</ul></li>
<li>service

<ul>
<li>centralized warehouse increases shipping time from the warehouse to the retailer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>transportation costs

<ul>
<li>number of warehouses <span  class="math">\(\uparrow\)</span> (if condition)</li>
<li>inbound transportation costs <span  class="math">\(\uparrow\)</span></li>
<li>quantity discounts are less likely to apply</li>
</ul></li>
<li>conclusions

<ul>
<li>it is possible that some products will be stored in a central facility while others will be kept in various local warehouses</li>
<li>very expensive products with low customer demand maybe stocked at a central warehouse</li>
<li>low-cost products facing high customer demand may be stocked at many local warehouses</li>
<li>critical to implement effective distribution strategies regardless of the total level of supply chain integration</li>
</ul></li>
