      <description>Public Key System Overview
 each party has 2 keys (no key distribution)  public key (open to the public) private key (secret to the owner)  mathematically, it is difficult to find the private key according to the public key security strength depends on key length   usage  encryption digital signature (unforgeable, no encryption -&amp;gt; message is public)  verfiy the origin of a message (not tampered) verify the identity of the sender (non-repudiation) reslove any authentication issues between the sender and the receiver   how to bind the private key and public key  using public key infrastructure  practical usage  encryption and signature can be used together combined with hash functions and symmetric key system  public key system depends on trap-door one-way function  examples  exponentiation:\(b = a^e\ mod\ p\) factorization:\(n = p\times q\)  RSA use this, except bitcoin (ECC) multiplication &amp;amp; factorization  e.</description>

      <description>Introduction  access control: deals with the prevention and detection of unauthorized actions by users of a computer system indentification and authentication: stating who you are and proving the identification claim with credentials
 username (identification) and password (authentication) other authentication techniques
 something you know, e.g. password      group password criteria tryÂ to crack the passwords     A passwords consists of &amp;gt;= 6 characters, with at least 1 non-letter 30% easy to crack (passwords easy to remember)   B passwords based on passphrases 10% were cracked (passwords easy to remember)   C passwords consists of 8 randomly selected characters 10% were cracked (passwords difficult to remember)     something you have, e.</description>

      <description>Overview Security threats (explain basically)
 content  eavesdropping: the message would be listened by others when you communicate with your friends, using email or whatsapp masquerading: identity stealing message tampering: someone modify the message in the middle replaying: receive the same message twice, it is dangerous in transactions, but not in instant message, etc  machine  infiltration: receive marewares (can control PC or smart phones) from hackers  traffic  traffic analysis: only interestes in how to communicate denial of service: make others cannot access the services   Security services (implemented by security mechanisms)</description>
