      <description>Overview Services and protocols
 transport segment from sending to receiving host network layer protocols in every Internet device, including hosts and routers IP provides best-effort services only two functions  forwarding (data plane): local action, move arriving packets from router&#39;s input link to appropriate router output link routing (control plane): global action, generated by routing algorithms and determine source-destination paths (end-to-end)  centralized (e.g. telephone network)  &amp;quot;emerging&amp;quot; approach under the context of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) routing is done by controller (a centralized server)  Q: Different routing algorithms can be easily used (why)?</description>

      <description>Transport-layer Services Transport Services and Protocols
 Provide logical communication (actually accomplished by network layer) between app processes on different hosts  logical communication means a pair of hosts is not connected physically, but it seems that they are connected by channel   Transport protocols run in end systems  send side: breaks app messages into segments (if needed), passes to network layer  using segment header, including port number, to communicate with the socket of receiver  receive side: reassembles segemnts into messages, uses segement header (or port number) to pass to application layer  More than one transport protocol available to apps  Majority: TCP and UDP  TCP: reliable, in-order delivery  congestion control flow control connection setup  UDP: unreliable, unordered delivery  no-frills extension of &amp;quot;best-effort&amp;quot; IP   Others: SCTP and DCCP  These protocols are very limited, so we just ignore them.</description>
