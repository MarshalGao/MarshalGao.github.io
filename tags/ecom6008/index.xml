      <description>Introduction Integration
 coordinate  production transportation inventory decisions  integrate  the front-end of the SC, customer demand, to the back-end of the SC, the production &amp;amp; manufacturing portion   Opportunities and challenges
 information availability activity coordination across the SC details  reduce cost better utilize resources increase service level reduce the bullwhip effect effectively respond to changes in the market   Exemplary approach
 strategy  push, pull, and push-pull strategy demand driven strategy internet strategy  integration  centralized vs.</description>

      <description>Lack of Coordination in Supply Chain Effect
 increase  manufacturing cost inventory cost replenishment lead time transportation cost labor cost for shipping and receiving  decrease  level of product availability relationships across the supply chain profitability  bullwhip effect  reduces supply chain profitability by making it more expensive to provide a given level of product availability   Obstacles
 incentive obstacles  when incentives offered to different stages or participants in a supply chain lead to actions that increase variability and reduce total supply chain profits – misalignment of total supply chain objectives and individual objectives local optimization within functions or stages of a supply chain sales force incentives  information processing obstacles  when demand information is distorted as it moves between different stages of the supply chain, leading to increased variability in orders within the supply chain forecasting based on orders, not customer demand lack of information sharing  operational obstacles  actions taken in the course of placing and filling orders that lead to an increase in variability ordering in large lots (much larger than dictated by demand) large replenishment lead times Rationing and shortage gaming  pricing obstacles  when pricing policies for a product lead to an increase in variability of orders placed lot-size based quantity decisions price fluctuations  behavioral obstacles  different stages react to the current local situation rather than trying to identify the root causes local analysis, different stages blame each other for the fluctuations, with successive stages becoming enemies rather than partners lack of trust results in opportunism, duplication of effort, and lack of information sharing   Bullwhip Effect Overview</description>

      <description>Demand Forecasting Overview
 problems  long lead times unreliable supply processes high demand variability a large number of SKU&#39;s  where do we hold inventory  suppliers and manufacturers warehouses and distribution centers retailers  types of inventory  raw materials work in process (WIP) finished goods   Handling inventory
 reasons  economies of scale  encourage firms to transport large quantities of items, and therefore hold large inventories  unexpected changes in customer demand  the short life cycle of an increasing number of products – historical data is unavailable the presence of many competing products in the marketplace – group vs.</description>

      <description>Introduction Overview
 why network planning  find the right balance between inventory, transportation and manufacturing costs match supply and demand under uncertainty by positioning and managing inventory effectively utilize resources effectively by sourcing products from the most appropriate manufacturing facility  three hierarchical steps  network design  number, locations and size of manufacturing plants &amp;amp; warehouses assignment of retail outlets to warehouses major sourcing decisions typical planning horizon is a few years  inventory positioning  identifying stocking points selecting facilities that will produce to stock &amp;amp; thus keep inventory selecting facilities that will produce to order &amp;amp; hence keep no inventory inventory management strategies  resource allocation  determine whether production and packaging of different products is done at the right facility what should be the plants sourcing strategies how much capacity each plant should have to meet seasonal demand    Logistic network</description>
