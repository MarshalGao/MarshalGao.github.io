      <description>Question Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.
+----+--------+ | Id | Salary | +----+--------+ | 1 | 100 | | 2 | 200 | | 3 | 300 | +----+--------+  For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.
+------------------------+ | getNthHighestSalary(2) | +------------------------+ | 200 | +------------------------+  My Interesting Code CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT BEGIN set N = N - 1; RETURN ( select distinct Salary as getNthHighestSalary from Employee order by Salary desc limit N, 1 ); END My Perspective For this question, firstly, you can order the salary.</description>
