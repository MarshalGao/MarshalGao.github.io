<h2 id="key-requirements-and-best-practice">Key Requirements and Best Practice</h2>
<p><strong>Risk-based approach</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>an FI should determine
<ul>
<li>the extent of CDD measure and ongoing monitoring by using a risk-based approach (“RBA”)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RBA depending upon
<ul>
<li>the background of the customer</li>
<li>the product, transaction or service used by the customer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>relevant factors to be considered
<ul>
<li>country risk</li>
<li>customer risk</li>
<li>product service risk</li>
<li>delivery distribution channel risk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>proportionate controls and oversight by determining

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Customer due diligence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>overview
<ul>
<li>the AMLO prescribes the circumstances in which an FI must carry out CDD</li>
<li>FIs may also need to conduct additional measures or could conduct simplified customer due diligence (“SDD”) depending on specific circumstances</li>
<li>an FI is required to carry out CDD measures when
<ul>
<li>opening account</li>
<li>occasional transaction, equal to or exceeding HK$120,000</li>
<li>wire transfer, equal to or exceeding HK$8,000</li>
<li>suspect/doubt money laundering</li>
<li>doubt the veracity or adequacy of any information previously obtained for the purpose of identifying the customer or verifying his/her identity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an FI is required to
<ul>
<li>identify the customer and verifying the customer’s identity using reliable, independent source documents, data, or information</li>
<li>identify the beneficial owner and may adopt a risk-based approach</li>
<li>obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship (if any) established with the FI</li>
<li>identify the person purports to act on behalf of the customer and taking reasonable measures to verify the person’s identity and verify the person’s authority to act on behalf of the customer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>timing of identification and verification of identity
<ul>
<li>an FI must complete the CDD process before or during the course of establishing a business relationship or conducting transactions for occasional customers</li>
<li>an FI may, exceptionally, verify the identity of a customer and any beneficial owner of the customer after establishing a business relationship if
<ul>
<li>the normal conduct of business with regard to the customer is not interrupted</li>
<li>risk of money laundering or terrorist financing is effectively managed</li>
</ul>

<li>corportation
<ul>
<li>an FI should obtain and verify the following information in relation to a customer which is a corporation
<ul>
<li>full name</li>
<li>date and place of incorporation</li>
<li>registration or incorporation number</li>
<li>registered office address in the place of incorporation (if the business address of the customer is different from the registered office address -&gt; the FI should obtain information on the business address and verify as far as practicable)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the FI should record the names of all directors and verify the identity of directors on a risk-based approach</li>
<li>an FI should verify the information from

</ul>
</li>
<li>high-risk situations
<ul>
<li>an FI must, in any situation that by its nature presents a higher risk of ML / TF, take additional measures or enhanced due diligence to mitigate the risk of ML / TF, including

</ul>
</li>
<li>non-face-to-face customers
<ul>
<li>when a customer is not physically present for identification purposes (i.e. the non-face-to-face customer), a FI or a DNFBP must carry out at least one of the following measures
<ul>
<li>obtain additional documents, data or information to further verify the customer’s identity</li>
<li>taking supplementary measures to verify “information relating to the customer that has been obtained by the FI or the DNFBP”</li>
<li>ensuring that the first payment made in relation to the customer’s account is carried out through an account opened in the customer’s name with –
<ul>
<li>an authorized institution</li>
<li>an institution that

</li>
<li>politically exposed person (PEP)
<ul>
<li>if a new customer or a beneficial owner of a new customer is a PEP, an FI or the DNFBP must
<ul>
<li>obtain approval from its senior management</li>
<li>take reasonable measures to establish the customer’s or beneficial owner’s source of wealth and the source of the funds that will be involved in the proposed business relationship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if an existing customer or a beneficial owner of an existing customer is a PEP or has become a PEP, an FI or the DNFBP must not continue its business relationship with the customer unless it
<ul>
<li>has obtained approval from its senior management</li>
<li>has taken reasonable measures to establish the customer’s or beneficial owner’s source of wealth and the source of the funds that will be involved in the proposed business relationship</li>

<li>between an FI and a foreign insititution if each of them acts on its own behalf</li>
<li>is carried out using a credit or debit card</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>risk-based approach
<ul>
<li>FIs should conduct ongoing monitoring in relation to all business relationships following the RBA</li>
<li>where the ML/TF risks are higher, the FI should conduct enhanced monitoring</li>
<li>in lower risk situations, the FI may reduce the extent of monitoring

<ul>
<li>when a transaction or a series of transactions of a customer is unusual (e.g. in a pattern that has no apparent economic or lawful purpose), the FI should take appropriate steps to further examine the transactions and identify if there is any suspicion</li>
<li>FIs should provide sufficient guidance to its staff</li>
<li>FIs should appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (“MLRO”)</li>
<li>FIs should establish and maintain procedures to ensure that
<ul>
<li>all staff are made aware of the identity of the MLRO and of the procedures to follow when making an internal disclosure report</li>
<li>all disclosure reports must reach the MLRO without undue delay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the internal report should include sufficient details of the customer concerned and the information giving rise to the suspicion</li>
<li>the review process should be documented, together with any conclusions drawn</li>
<li>if after completing the evaluation, the MLRO decides that there are grounds for knowledge or suspicion, he should disclose the information and file a suspicious transaction report (“STR”) to the JFIU as soon as it is reasonable to do so</li>
<li>FIs must establish and maintain a record of all STRs made to the JFIU, the record must include
<ul>
<li>details of the date of the STR</li>
<li>the person who made the STR</li>
<li>information to allow the papers relevant to the STR to be located</li>

<li>an institution located in a place outside Hong Kong who uses local accounts to trade on stock / futures exchanges located in that place</li>
<li>requests by customers for investment management services (as regards securities, futures contracts or leveraged foreign exchange contracts) where the source of the funds is unclear or not consistent with the customers' apparent standing</li>
<li>a number of transactions by the same customer in small amounts relating to the same investment, each purchased for cash and then sold in one transaction, the proceeds being paid to a person other than that customer</li>
<li>frequent funds or other property transfers or cheque payments to or from third parties that are unrelated, unverified or difficult to verify</li>
<li>incoming payments made by cheques with multiple endorsements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SFC suggestions
<ul>
<li>defining comprehensive parameters and thresholds for transaction monitoring in a wide range of situations which might give rise to suspicions. More stringent monitoring thresholds were applied to customers assessed to be of higher ML/TF risk</li>
<li>performing annual reviews of the parameters and thresholds used in its automated transaction monitoring system to ensure its effectiveness in identifying potentially suspicious transactions and reducing false positives</li>
<li>adopting a policy of not accepting any third-party fund deposits. For direct fund deposits, the LC would require customers to produce evidence to show the source of funds when the amount exceeded a certain threshold</li>
<li>evaluating the reasonableness of third-party fund deposits. Obtaining corroborative evidence from the customers or other sources to verify their purported relationship with the third parties and the reasons for the third-party deposits</li>

<p><strong>Staff training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>definition
<ul>
<li>provide and ensure adequate and appropriate AMLs/CTF training</li>
<li>the scope and frequency of training should be tailored to the specific risks faced by the FI and pitched according to the job functions, responsibilities and experience of the staff, i.e. new staff, front-line personnel, back-office staff, managerial staff and MLROs</li>
