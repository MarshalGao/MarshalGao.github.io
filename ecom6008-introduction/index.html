<h2 id="why-scm">Why SCM</h2>
<p><strong>Cost of SCM</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>within manufacturing plants and warehouses and between different components
<ul>
<li>movement</li>
<li>storage</li>
<li>control</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>investment including unnecessary cost
<ul>
<li>redundant stock</li>
<li>inefficient transportation strategies</li>
<li>other wasteful practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What makes SCM difficult</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>global optimization
<ul>
<li>desgin and operate a supply chain so that total system wide costs are minimized and system wide service levels are maintained</li>
<li>single facility vs. entire system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>uncertainty
<ul>
<li>eliminate as much uncertainty as possible and deal effectively with the remaining</li>
<li>customer demand, travel times, machines, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>strategies for SCM
<ul>
<li>all of the advanced strategies, techniques, and approaches for SCM focus on
<ul>
<li>global optimization</li>
<li>managing uncertainty</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global optimization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sequential optimization vs. global optimization
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarshalGao/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2021-05-29%2016.39.07.png" alt=""></li>
<li>why is global optimization hard
<ul>
<li>SC is a complex network
<ul>
<li>dispersed over a large geography</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SC may have different &amp; conflicting objectives
<ul>
<li>material – supplier v.s. manufacturer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SC is a dynamic system
<ul>
<li>customer demand &amp; supplier capabilities</li>
<li>SC relationships change over time; power structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SC varies over time
<ul>
<li>seasonal fluctuations, trends, advertising and promotions, competitors' pricing strategies, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Managing uncertainty</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>contains
<ul>
<li>matching supply &amp; demand
<ul>
<li>what management gets
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarshalGao/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2021-05-29%2016.49.11.png" alt=""></li>
<li>what management wants
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarshalGao/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2021-05-29%2016.49.22.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>forecasting does not solve the problem
<ul>
<li>it is impossible to predict the precise demand for a specific item, even with the most advanced forecast techniques</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>inventory &amp; back-order levels fluctuate considerably across the supply chain
<ul>
<li>bullwhip effect</li>
<li>even when customer demand for specific products does not vary greatly</li>
<li>distributor orders to the factory fluctuate far more than the underlying retailer demand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>demand is not the only source of uncertainty
<ul>
<li>delivery lead times, manufacturing yields, transportation times, and component availability</li>
<li>as supply chains become larger and more geographically diverse, natural &amp; man-made disasters can have tremendous impact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>recent trends make things more uncertain
<ul>
<li>lean manufacturing</li>
<li>outsourcing</li>
<li>off-shoring</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>dealing with uncertainty
<ul>
<li>pull systems</li>
<li>risk pooling</li>
<li>centralization</li>
<li>postponement</li>
<li>strategic alliances</li>
<li>collaborative forecasting</li>

<h2 id="challenges-of-scm">Challenges of SCM</h2>
<p><strong>Common distribution strategies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>traditional distribution strategy
<ul>
<li>inventory is kept at the warehouses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>cross-docking
<ul>
<li>operating strategy at flow consolidation centers - from the receiving dock to shipping dock directly without storage</li>
<li>eliminates or significantly reduces the inventory at these centers</li>
<li>improve transit time &amp; transportation cost without increasing inventory
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarshalGao/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2021-05-29%2018.58.35.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>direct shipping
<ul>
<li>goods are distributed from the suppliers directly to the retail stores</li>
<li>avoiding warehouses altogether</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major concerns</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to yield a globally optimized supply chain
<ul>
<li>each facility or party in the chain makes decisions with little regard to their impact on other supply chain partners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the ability to effectively manage uncertainty
<ul>
<li>product life cycles are becoming shorter &amp; shorter</li>
<li>new products, no historical data are available</li>
<li>proliferation of products</li>
<li>significant price declines</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>strategic level
<ul>
<li>long-lasting effect on the firm</li>
<li>number, location &amp; capacity of warehouses and manufacturing plants, and the flow of material through the logistics network</li>
<li>acquisition of new production equipment and the design of working centers within each plant</li>
<li>design of transportation facilities, comm equipment, data processing means, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tactical level
<ul>
<li>updated anywhere between once every quarter &amp; once every year</li>
<li>purchasing and production decisions, inventory policies, work-force size, and transportation strategies (e.g., frequency)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>operational level
<ul>
<li>refers to day-to-day decisions</li>
<li>scheduling, lead time quotations, routing, and truck loading</li>
<li>the assignment of customer orders to individual machines</li>
