      <description>Framework for Strategic Alliances Introduction
 overview  it may not always be effective to perform all of key business functions in-house 4 basic ways to ensure that a logistics related business function is completed  internal activities  a firm can perform the activity using internal resources and expertise, if they are available if this activity is one of the core strengths of the firm, this may be the best way to perform the activity  acquisitions  a firm does not have the expertise or specialized resources internally, it can acquire another firm that does several possible drawbacks  difficult and expensive culture may clash with that of the acquiring company company&#39;s competitors   arm&#39;s-length transactions  most business transactions are of this type specific item or service  delivery of a load of items maintenance of a vehicle design and installation of logistics management software purchases or leases the item or service  short-term arrangement fulfils a particular business need - but doesn&#39;t lead to long-term strategic advantages  strategic alliances  typically multifaceted, goal-oriented, long- term partnerships between two companies in which both risks &amp;amp; rewards are shared typically lead to long-term strategic benefits for both partners     strategic partners  with supply chain partners with non-supply chain partners  financial company logistics company IT company  homogeneous partners (the same type people) heterogeneous partners (different types people)  potential benefits of alliances  adding value to products  for example, partnerships that improve time to market, distribution times, or repair times help to increase the perceived value of a particular firm similarly, partnerships between companies with complementary product lines can add value to both companies’ products one product is popular in winter, and the other one is popular in summer, they can share  improving market access  partnerships that lead to better advertising or increased access to new market channels can be beneficial for example, complementary consumer product manufacturers can cooperate to address the needs of major retailers, increasing sales for everyone  strengthening operations  alliances with appropriate firms can help improve operations - system costs and cycle times.</description>

      <description>Lack of Coordination in Supply Chain Effect
 increase  manufacturing cost inventory cost replenishment lead time transportation cost labor cost for shipping and receiving  decrease  level of product availability relationships across the supply chain profitability  bullwhip effect  reduces supply chain profitability by making it more expensive to provide a given level of product availability   Obstacles
 incentive obstacles  when incentives offered to different stages or participants in a supply chain lead to actions that increase variability and reduce total supply chain profits – misalignment of total supply chain objectives and individual objectives local optimization within functions or stages of a supply chain sales force incentives  information processing obstacles  when demand information is distorted as it moves between different stages of the supply chain, leading to increased variability in orders within the supply chain forecasting based on orders, not customer demand lack of information sharing  operational obstacles  actions taken in the course of placing and filling orders that lead to an increase in variability ordering in large lots (much larger than dictated by demand) large replenishment lead times Rationing and shortage gaming  pricing obstacles  when pricing policies for a product lead to an increase in variability of orders placed lot-size based quantity decisions price fluctuations  behavioral obstacles  different stages react to the current local situation rather than trying to identify the root causes local analysis, different stages blame each other for the fluctuations, with successive stages becoming enemies rather than partners lack of trust results in opportunism, duplication of effort, and lack of information sharing   Bullwhip Effect Overview</description>

 problems  long lead times unreliable supply processes high demand variability a large number of SKU&#39;s  where do we hold inventory  suppliers and manufacturers warehouses and distribution centers retailers  types of inventory  raw materials work in process (WIP) finished goods   Handling inventory
 reasons  economies of scale  encourage firms to transport large quantities of items, and therefore hold large inventories  unexpected changes in customer demand  the short life cycle of an increasing number of products – historical data is unavailable the presence of many competing products in the marketplace – group vs.</description>

      <description>Introduction Overview
 why network planning  find the right balance between inventory, transportation and manufacturing costs match supply and demand under uncertainty by positioning and managing inventory effectively utilize resources effectively by sourcing products from the most appropriate manufacturing facility  three hierarchical steps  network design  number, locations and size of manufacturing plants &amp;amp; warehouses assignment of retail outlets to warehouses major sourcing decisions typical planning horizon is a few years  inventory positioning  identifying stocking points selecting facilities that will produce to stock &amp;amp; thus keep inventory selecting facilities that will produce to order &amp;amp; hence keep no inventory inventory management strategies  resource allocation  determine whether production and packaging of different products is done at the right facility what should be the plants sourcing strategies how much capacity each plant should have to meet seasonal demand    Logistic network</description>

      <description>Trade Based Money Laundering (TBML) Overview
 definition  the process of disguising the proceeds of crime and moving value through the use of trade transactions in an attempt to legitimize their illicit origins or their activities contains lots of transactions   aim  is not the movement of goods, but the movement of money, which the trade transactions facilitate   trade process and financing  international trade involves a range of risks for the parties involved, leading to uncertainty over the timing of payments between the exporter and importer the Wolfsberg Group notes approximately 80% of international trade processed by FIs is open account trading  “open account transaction” involves a sale where the goods are shipped and delivered before payment is due   TBML schemes frequently involve this method because financial institutions have a reduced role on the documentary collection process in the transaction    TBML Risks &amp;amp; Trends Economic sectors and products vulnerable to TBML activities</description>
