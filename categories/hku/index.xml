      <description>Public Key System Overview
 each party has 2 keys (no key distribution)  public key (open to the public) private key (secret to the owner)  mathematically, it is difficult to find the private key according to the public key security strength depends on key length   usage  encryption digital signature (unforgeable, no encryption -&amp;gt; message is public)  verfiy the origin of a message (not tampered) verify the identity of the sender (non-repudiation) reslove any authentication issues between the sender and the receiver   how to bind the private key and public key  using public key infrastructure  practical usage  encryption and signature can be used together combined with hash functions and symmetric key system  public key system depends on trap-door one-way function  examples  exponentiation:\(b = a^e\ mod\ p\) factorization:\(n = p\times q\)  RSA use this, except bitcoin (ECC) multiplication &amp;amp; factorization  e.</description>

      <description>Strategy and Digital Dynamic Capabilities Two complementary strategy approaches
 Porter&amp;rsquo;s industry-level competitive advantage analysis  industry contains lots of firms firms would compete with each other a firm want to be better, it should do better than the industry average example: mobile industry pre-2007  strategic recommendations to companies below the average  raise price through differentiation  can do something in design, e.g. Samsung and Armani   lower cost to improve profitability  it was not very easy to do because what you could do for cost was already being driven down as much as possible globally           firm-level dynamic capabilities analysis  start by the firm firms can actually disrupt, shape and transform entire industries example: Apple transformed mobile industry in 2008  by digital innovation (AppStore)  combining and collaborating have a company like Apple who can orchestrate that collaboration on a platform   apple provide a platform (inside) for developers (outside)      Dynamic digital capabilities</description>

      <description>Introduction  access control: deals with the prevention and detection of unauthorized actions by users of a computer system indentification and authentication: stating who you are and proving the identification claim with credentials
 username (identification) and password (authentication) other authentication techniques
 something you know, e.g. password      group password criteria tryÂ to crack the passwords     A passwords consists of &amp;gt;= 6 characters, with at least 1 non-letter 30% easy to crack (passwords easy to remember)   B passwords based on passphrases 10% were cracked (passwords easy to remember)   C passwords consists of 8 randomly selected characters 10% were cracked (passwords difficult to remember)     something you have, e.</description>

      <description>Overview Services and protocols
 transport segment from sending to receiving host network layer protocols in every Internet device, including hosts and routers IP provides best-effort services only two functions  forwarding (data plane): local action, move arriving packets from router&#39;s input link to appropriate router output link routing (control plane): global action, generated by routing algorithms and determine source-destination paths (end-to-end)  centralized (e.g. telephone network)  &amp;quot;emerging&amp;quot; approach under the context of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) routing is done by controller (a centralized server)  Q: Different routing algorithms can be easily used (why)?</description>

      <description>Overview Security threats (explain basically)
 content  eavesdropping: the message would be listened by others when you communicate with your friends, using email or whatsapp masquerading: identity stealing message tampering: someone modify the message in the middle replaying: receive the same message twice, it is dangerous in transactions, but not in instant message, etc  machine  infiltration: receive marewares (can control PC or smart phones) from hackers  traffic  traffic analysis: only interestes in how to communicate denial of service: make others cannot access the services   Security services (implemented by security mechanisms)</description>

      <description>Transport-layer Services Transport Services and Protocols
 Provide logical communication (actually accomplished by network layer) between app processes on different hosts  logical communication means a pair of hosts is not connected physically, but it seems that they are connected by channel   Transport protocols run in end systems  send side: breaks app messages into segments (if needed), passes to network layer  using segment header, including port number, to communicate with the socket of receiver  receive side: reassembles segemnts into messages, uses segement header (or port number) to pass to application layer  More than one transport protocol available to apps  Majority: TCP and UDP  TCP: reliable, in-order delivery  congestion control flow control connection setup  UDP: unreliable, unordered delivery  no-frills extension of &amp;quot;best-effort&amp;quot; IP   Others: SCTP and DCCP  These protocols are very limited, so we just ignore them.</description>
