      <description>Overview Security Threats (explain basically)
 Content  eavesdropping: the message would be listened by others when you communicate with your friends, using email or whatsapp masquerading: identity stealing message tampering: someone modify the message in the middle replaying: receive the same message twice, it is dangerous in transactions, but not in instant message, etc  Machine  infiltration: receive marewares (can control PC or smart phones) from hackers  Traffic  traffic analysis: only interestes in how to communicate denial of service: make others cannot access the services   Security Services (implemented by security mechanisms)</description>

      <description>Transport-layer Services Transport Services and Protocols
 Provide logical communication (actually accomplished by network layer) between app processes on different hosts  logical communication means a pair of hosts is not connected physically, but it seems that they are connected by channel   Transport protocols run in end systems  send side: breaks app messages into segments (if needed), passes to network layer  using segment header, including port number, to communicate with the socket of receiver  receive side: reassembles segemnts into messages, uses segement header (or port number) to pass to application layer  More than one transport protocol available to apps  Majority: TCP and UDP  TCP: reliable, in-order delivery  congestion control flow control connection setup  UDP: unreliable, unordered delivery  no-frills extension of &amp;quot;best-effort&amp;quot; IP   Others: SCTP and DCCP  These protocols are very limited, so we just ignore them.</description>
