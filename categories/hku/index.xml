      <description>Introduction  access control: deals with the prevention and detection of unauthorized actions by users of a computer system indentification and authentication: stating who you are and proving the identification claim with credentials
 username (identification) and password (authentication) other authentication techniques
 something you know, e.g. password      group password criteria tryÂ to crack the passwords     A passwords consists of &amp;gt;= 6 characters, with at least 1 non-letter 30% easy to crack (passwords easy to remember)   B passwords based on passphrases 10% were cracked (passwords easy to remember)   C passwords consists of 8 randomly selected characters 10% were cracked (passwords difficult to remember)     something you have, e.</description>

      <description>Overview Services and protocols
 transport segment from sending to receiving host network layer protocols in every Internet device, including hosts and routers IP provides best-effort services only two functions  forwarding (data plane): local action, move arriving packets from router&#39;s input link to appropriate router output link routing (control plane): global action, generated by routing algorithms and determine source-destination paths (end-to-end)  centralized (e.g. telephone network)  &amp;quot;emerging&amp;quot; approach under the context of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) routing is done by controller (a centralized server)  Q: Different routing algorithms can be easily used (why)?</description>

      <description>Overview Security threats (explain basically)
 content  eavesdropping: the message would be listened by others when you communicate with your friends, using email or whatsapp masquerading: identity stealing message tampering: someone modify the message in the middle replaying: receive the same message twice, it is dangerous in transactions, but not in instant message, etc  machine  infiltration: receive marewares (can control PC or smart phones) from hackers  traffic  traffic analysis: only interestes in how to communicate denial of service: make others cannot access the services   Security services (implemented by security mechanisms)</description>

      <description>Transport-layer Services Transport Services and Protocols
 Provide logical communication (actually accomplished by network layer) between app processes on different hosts  logical communication means a pair of hosts is not connected physically, but it seems that they are connected by channel   Transport protocols run in end systems  send side: breaks app messages into segments (if needed), passes to network layer  using segment header, including port number, to communicate with the socket of receiver  receive side: reassembles segemnts into messages, uses segement header (or port number) to pass to application layer  More than one transport protocol available to apps  Majority: TCP and UDP  TCP: reliable, in-order delivery  congestion control flow control connection setup  UDP: unreliable, unordered delivery  no-frills extension of &amp;quot;best-effort&amp;quot; IP   Others: SCTP and DCCP  These protocols are very limited, so we just ignore them.</description>
