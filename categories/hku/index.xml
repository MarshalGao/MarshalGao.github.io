      <description>PKI Overview
 PKC &amp;amp; PKI  PKC is about math, but PKI is about binding a pair of key to one person   definition  PKI is a set of hardware, software, people, policies and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates PKI is an arrangement that binds public keys with respective user identities by means of a certificate authority (CA)  the binding is established through the registration and issuance process the PKI role that assures this binding is called the registration authority (RA): it ensures that the public key is bound to the individual to which it is assigned in a way that ensures non-repudiation   law for digital signature, e.</description>

      <description>Public Key System Overview
 each party has 2 keys (no key distribution)  public key (open to the public) private key (secret to the owner)  mathematically, it is difficult to find the private key according to the public key security strength depends on key length   usage  encryption digital signature (unforgeable, no encryption -&amp;gt; message is public)  verfiy the origin of a message (not tampered) verify the identity of the sender (non-repudiation) reslove any authentication issues between the sender and the receiver   how to bind the private key and public key  using public key infrastructure  practical usage  encryption and signature can be used together combined with hash functions and symmetric key system  public key system depends on trap-door one-way function  examples  exponentiation:\(b = a^e\ mod\ p\) factorization:\(n = p\times q\)  RSA use this, except bitcoin (ECC) multiplication &amp;amp; factorization  e.</description>

      <description>Strategy and Digital Dynamic Capabilities Two complementary strategy approaches
 Porter&amp;rsquo;s industry-level competitive advantage analysis  industry contains lots of firms firms would compete with each other a firm want to be better, it should do better than the industry average example: mobile industry pre-2007  strategic recommendations to companies below the average  raise price through differentiation  can do something in design, e.g. Samsung and Armani   lower cost to improve profitability  it was not very easy to do because what you could do for cost was already being driven down as much as possible globally           firm-level dynamic capabilities analysis  start by the firm firms can actually disrupt, shape and transform entire industries example: Apple transformed mobile industry in 2008  by digital innovation (AppStore)  combining and collaborating have a company like Apple who can orchestrate that collaboration on a platform   apple provide a platform (inside) for developers (outside)      Dynamic digital capabilities</description>

 username (identification) and password (authentication) other authentication techniques
 something you know, e.g. password      group password criteria tryÂ to crack the passwords     A passwords consists of &amp;gt;= 6 characters, with at least 1 non-letter 30% easy to crack (passwords easy to remember)   B passwords based on passphrases 10% were cracked (passwords easy to remember)   C passwords consists of 8 randomly selected characters 10% were cracked (passwords difficult to remember)     something you have, e.</description>

      <description>Overview Services and protocols
 transport segment from sending to receiving host network layer protocols in every Internet device, including hosts and routers IP provides best-effort services only two functions  forwarding (data plane): local action, move arriving packets from router&#39;s input link to appropriate router output link routing (control plane): global action, generated by routing algorithms and determine source-destination paths (end-to-end)  centralized (e.g. telephone network)  &amp;quot;emerging&amp;quot; approach under the context of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) routing is done by controller (a centralized server)  Q: Different routing algorithms can be easily used (why)?</description>
